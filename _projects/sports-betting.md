The project utilizes LightGBM regression to develop a model to find opportunity in the sports betting markets, primarily college football. The repository catalogues the steps including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning. Notebooks test various hypotheses and experiments for model choices and optimal betting strategy to document the project's progression.
