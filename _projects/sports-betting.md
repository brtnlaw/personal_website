The project utilizes LightGBM regression and a research framework to develop a model that weds domain knowledge with significant testing to find opportunity in the sports betting markets, particularly within college football. The repository catalogues the steps including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning. In notebooks, I test various hypotheses and experiments for model choices and optimal betting strategy to document the project's progression. The link is here.
